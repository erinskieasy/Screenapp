The user has a React hero section component with a video background. The goal is to add a semi-transparent dark overlay on top of the video to improve the readability of the text content within the hero section.

Problem Area in the Code:

The relevant section of the code is within the isVideo conditional block in the HeroSection component's return statement:

JavaScript

{isVideo ? (
  <div className={`absolute inset-0 z-0 overflow-hidden transition-opacity duration-500 ${isMediaLoaded ? 'opacity-100' : 'opacity-0'}`}>
    <video
      className="absolute top-0 left-0 min-w-full min-h-full object-cover"
      autoPlay
      muted
      loop
      playsInline
      src={backgroundMediaUrl}
      onLoadedData={() => setIsMediaLoaded(true)}
    />
    {/* This is where the overlay needs to be added */}
  </div>
) : (
  // ... image background code ...
)}
Currently, the video plays without any overlay. We need to insert a div element within this block, directly after the <video> tag, to act as the dark overlay.

Agreed Solution:

We've agreed to add a div element with specific Tailwind CSS classes to create the semi-transparent dark overlay. This div will be positioned absolutely to cover the entire video container and will have a dark background color with some transparency.

Implementation Steps:

To implement this solution, please add the following div element as a direct child of the main div that contains the <video> tag within the isVideo block:

JavaScript

<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-40"></div>
Alternatively, the user also suggested using a dark grey color with opacity, which can be achieved with:

JavaScript

<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gray-900/40"></div>
Either of these div elements, placed directly after the <video> tag, will create the desired dark overlay on top of the video background. The absolute inset-0 classes ensure it spans the entire video area, and the bg-black bg-opacity-40 or bg-gray-900/40 classes apply the dark, semi-transparent background.

Please ensure this new div is correctly nested within the isVideo block as described above.
