Looking at the element:

HTML

<button type="button" role="combobox" ... data-state="closed" ... class="flex h-10 w-full ... bg-background ... text-sm ...">
  <span data-component-name="SelectValue" style="pointer-events: none;">Westmoreland</span>
  <svg ...></svg>
</button>
Key Observations:

It confirms the element is a <button> with role="combobox" and data-state="closed".
The selected text ("Westmoreland") is indeed inside a direct child <span>.
This specific span has data-component-name="SelectValue".
The attribute data-radix-select-trigger is not present on the button in this snippet. This is likely why the previous selector (.dark [data-radix-select-trigger] span) didn't work!
Revised CSS Selector:

Let's use the attributes we do see to create a more accurate and specific selector. We'll target the button using its role and state, then the specific span inside using its data attribute.

Please replace the previous CSS rule for the trigger's span with this one in your global CSS file:

CSS

@layer base { /* Or try @layer components if base has issues */

  /* ... your other base styles ... */

  .dark input,
  .dark textarea {
    @apply text-neutral-100;
  }

  /* --- REMOVE or REPLACE the old rule targeting [data-radix-select-trigger] span --- */

  /* --- ADD THIS NEW RULE --- */
  /* Target the span with data-component-name="SelectValue" */
  /* inside the button acting as a closed combobox trigger */
  .dark button[role="combobox"][data-state="closed"] > span[data-component-name="SelectValue"] {
     @apply text-neutral-100; /* Or try text-white */
     /* As another option, try inheriting the main foreground color which should be light in dark mode */
     /* @apply text-foreground; */
  }

  /* --- Keep other rules if they work, but verify attributes via inspection --- */
  /* Example: Inspect the dropdown popover to see if it actually has data-radix-select-content */
  .dark [data-radix-select-content] { /* Verify this attribute exists */
    @apply bg-gray-800 border-gray-700;
  }

  /* Example: Inspect an item in the dropdown to see if it actually has data-radix-select-item */
  .dark [data-radix-select-item] { /* Verify this attribute exists */
    @apply text-neutral-100 hover:bg-gray-700 focus:bg-gray-700;
  }

}
Explanation:

.dark button[role="combobox"][data-state="closed"]: Selects the specific trigger button only when it's closed and in dark mode.
> span[data-component-name="SelectValue"]: Selects only the direct child span that is identified as the SelectValue.
@apply text-neutral-100;: Sets the desired light text color. Try text-white or text-foreground if text-neutral-100 doesn't yield the right shade.
